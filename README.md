task3.py includes all necessary functions(cubic polynomial, inverse kinematics with orientation) for 3DOF planar robot arm in gazebo simulation. images are outcomes (joint angles and end effector position) of running "$ rosrun robot_move task3.py _targets:="[[0.2,0.1,1.5],[0.1,0.2,1.5],[0.0,0.25,1.5]]" " command. _targets is a parameter that states the via points in XY space for end effector to pass. in brackets, parameter1 is x position, parameter2 is y position and parameter3 is end effector angle phi
.m MATLAB file generates workspace for 3DOF planar robot with link lenghts of 135mm and end effector offset of 46.7mm. two images are workspace plots of joint angle limits of -45 to 45 and -90 to 90 degrees.
